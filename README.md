Player - Kotlin Android App


**The Activities that is included in my project are**

1.Player Activity
2.ListPlayer Activity
3.Maps Activity
4.Splash Activity

**Inspiration**
Having a big interest in football it was always going to be my first idea to build an app around football. Having an app in which you can view players and information about them is a great idea especially for kids who idolises these players. The App allows you to have the freedom to add in any player you want with a few easy steps. Simplicity was the main aim when creating the App. I wanted it to be easy to use to help younger users of the app and also have a good design.

**Functionality**

The main functions of this App is to be able to add players from popular football clubs and give information about them. You will be able to update or delete this information at any time. The information that you can add in about the player is:
1.Player Name
2.Players Club
3.Players Position
4.Player Rating
5.Player Image
6.Clubs Location
When you add in the player it will then show up in a card view showing the name, club, image and position of the player.
